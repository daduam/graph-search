## Instructions

Program breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative deepening and A* Search in the Java Programming language. Your program should be interactive. Allow the users to input the number of elements in the search space and the number of edges in the graph, then you create a graph for that. Let the user then input the search goal and the algorithm to use for the searching. Use the goal and traverse to give the user the desired output.

Compute the running time for each algorithm after the search is complete.
